# Ourea

Ourea is a library to decode ordinary strings to runnable code.

## Design goals

The goal of the library is to simplify and minimize time spent on query structuring.
If a customer wants a reporting system for their CMS or ecommerce site this is going to make that easy.
My goal is to bring a similar interface of wolfram alpha to everyone.

## How to use

The API of the library is still something that I'm experimenting with.
I'm having a hard time figuring out the best possible way to hook it up with both new and existing applications.

## The future
